# whowouldwin

An old PHP project from my younger years. I like numbers, I like superheroes, I like statistics and RPG games. This is a PHP web app that lets you create superheroes and make them fight in a brawl to the death!!!

www.whowouldwin.io for a lame demo with a concept frontend end. I like to make cool things, I don't care so much how they look. I'm sorry in advance for any offense my design choices may cause you :)
